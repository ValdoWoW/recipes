        <p>Feeding your sourdough starter? Taking the discard and putting it in banana bread gives this favorite quick loaf a subtle tang that nicely balances the sweetness of the bananas and honey. Plus, your bread will stay fresh longer — what a great way to use up any excess starter you might otherwise throw away!</p>

        <p>Yield: 1 loaf, 12 generous servings.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter, at cool room temperature</li>
            <li>2/3 cup (142g) light brown sugar or dark brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Baking Powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups (397g) mashed ripe banana, from about 1 3/4 pounds unpeeled bananas</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (85g) Honey</li>
            <li>2 large Eggs</li>
            <li>/2 cup (113g) sourdough starter, unfed/discard</li>
            <li>2 cups (240g) All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (85g) chopped nuts, optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan; or a 12" x 4" tea loaf pan.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the butter, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder, and salt, beating until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the mashed bananas, honey, eggs, and sourdough starter, again beating until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the flour then the nuts, stirring just until smooth.</li>
            <li>Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan, smoothing the top. Let it rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bake the bread for 45 minutes, then gently lay a piece of aluminum foil across the top to prevent over-browning.</li>
            <li>Bake for an additional 25 minutes (20 minutes if you're baking in a tea loaf pan). Remove the bread from the oven; a long toothpick or thin paring knife inserted into the center should come out clean, with a few wet crumbs clinging to it. The tester shouldn't show any sign of uncooked batter. If it does, bake the bread an additional 5 minutes, or until it tests done.</li>
            <li>Allow the bread to cool for 10 minutes in the pan. Remove it from the pan and cool completely on a rack.</li>
            <li>Store leftover bread, tightly wrapped, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.</li>
        </ol>
