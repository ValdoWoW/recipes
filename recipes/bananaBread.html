        <p>Feeding your sourdough starter? Taking the discard and putting it in banana bread gives this favorite quick loaf a subtle tang that nicely balances the sweetness of the bananas and honey. Plus, your bread will stay fresh longer â€” what a great way to use up any excess starter you might otherwise throw away!</p>
