        <p>Recipe taken from <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/">King Arthur Baking</a></p>

        <p>These big, palm-sized biscuits are perfect for a breakfast sandwich. Their sourdough tang pairs nicely with egg, ham, sausage, or whatever you choose to stuff them with. Better yet — the recipe uses your "discard" sourdough, the extra starter you might otherwise throw away during the feeding process.</p>

        <p>Yield: 6 to 7 large biscuits.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (120g) All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Baking Powder</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons (113g) Unsalted Butter, cold</li>
            <li>1 cup (227g) Sourdough Starter, unfeed/discard</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F, with a rack in the upper third. Grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment.</li>
            <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Work the butter into the flour until the mixture is unevenly crumbly.</li>
            <li>Add the starter, mixing gently until the dough is cohesive.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (a piece of parchment works well), and gently pat it into a 6" round about 1"-thick.</li>
            <li>Use a sharp 2 3/8" biscuit cutter to cut four rounds, cutting them as close to one another as possible. Gently push and pat the scraps into a 2 1/2" x 5" rectangle. Cut two more biscuits. Push and pat the remaining scraps into a 1"-thick biscuit; it'll be slightly smaller than the others.</li>
            <li>Place the sourdough biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2" between them; they'll spread as they bake.</li>
            <li>Bake the sourdough biscuits in the upper third of your oven for 20 to 23 minutes, until they're golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the sourdough biscuits from the oven, and serve warm. Or cool completely, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature for several days. Freeze, well-wrapped, for longer storage.</li>
        </ol>
