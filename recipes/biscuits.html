        <p>Recipe taken from <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/">King Arthur Baking</a></p>

        <p>These big, palm-sized biscuits are perfect for a breakfast sandwich. Their sourdough tang pairs nicely with egg, ham, sausage, or whatever you choose to stuff them with. Better yet â€” the recipe uses your "discard" sourdough, the extra starter you might otherwise throw away during the feeding process.</p>
