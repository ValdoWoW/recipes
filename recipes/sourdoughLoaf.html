        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <p>The <em>key</em> to making great sourdough bread is to control the <strong>fermentation process</strong>. This is the one parameter that you need to understand and master, the rest is just 20%. That's why you want to make sure to have a healthy and active sourdough starter.</p>

        <h2>Readying the sourdough starter</h2>

        <p>Your sourdough should be able to double in size within 5-10 hours after a feeding at room temperature. If it does, then perfect. If not, consider feeding your starter with the below shown process. Furthermore you want to check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkTrGHNW2w">this video on 4 tips that will make your sourdough starter more active.</a></p>

        <img src="/img/starterProcess.jpg" alt="Image decribing the process of 2 1:5:5 refeedings two days before baking">

        <p>Note the 1:5:5 in the image means, 10 grams of sourdough starter, 50 grams of flour and 50 grams of water. You want to be feeding ideally whole rye, or whole wheat flour. This will make a more active sourdough starter.</p>

        <h2>Autolyse</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix flour and water, fully hydrating flour.</li>
                <li>Let it rest at room temperature over night.</li>
                <li>Make sure that there are no crumbly parts of flour left.</li>
            </ol>
        
        <h2>Bulk Fermentation</h2>

        <p>In the morning on Friday you want to mix everything together. This starts the <strong>bulk fermentation</strong> stage. Bulk since you could actually be doubling all the ingredients and then you could make 2..N breads at the same time.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Add the active starter to the main dough.</li>
            <li>Add the salt to the main dough.</li>
            <li>Mix until everything is nicely homogenized. (very important!)</li>
            <ol>
                <li>For me this takes around 1 minute.</li>
                <li>It might take you up to 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
        <li>You want to make sure the sourdough starter has been evenly spread accross the dough.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Let the dough sit for another 15 minutes covered. I like to use a large metal pot. This makes sure the gluten network forms again after we damaged it while adding the starter.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Now remove the dough and place it on your bench. (no flour!)</li>
            <li>Extract a small sample from the dough and place it in a cylidrical shaped container.</li>
            <li>A shot glass works, or anything else that has a cylindric shape. This sample will tell us exactly when the dough is done bulk fermenting. Mark the dough with a rubber band or a marker. This way we can see the size increase.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Next up <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHL44ONu3so">we want to create dough strength</a></strong>. There are multiple ways we can do that, however for this recipe we will be doing a set of bench kneading only. The higher you go in hydration, the more dough strength you have to build. You could of course also be using a mixer to do the same thing.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Proceed with kneading the dough on the bench. It's important that you have no flour on the surface.</li>
            <li>Pull the dough as far out as you can, without tearing it.</li>
            <li>fold over the dough to glue itself together.</li>
            <li>Repeat once from each side.</li>
            <li>Drag the dough over the surface using your hands at a 45Â° angle.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>This only works because the dough is stuck on the surface.</li>
                    <li>Your dough ball should become nice and round.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Wait a minute, repeat the same process 3 times.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Great. You have now built a dough with a lot of strength. Return the dough to your container, it should be a nice and smooth round ball. If it is not, wait another 15 minutes, return it to the surface, practice rounding the dough ball one more time.</p>

        <p>Make sure that your dough sample has been properly marked in the container. It's crucial that you homogenized the dough properly initially, else the dough sample might be slower or faster than the main dough. Ideally both should be close together and the dough should be the same temperature as your room temperature. This way both doughs ferment at the same speed.</p>

        <p>Depending on the amount of protein (out of which 80% is gluten for wheat), we need to aim for a different size increase. The more gluten you have, the more you can inflate the dough. This is crucial to know. Furthermore, the more gluten you have, the longer you can ferment your dough. Over time the gluten is damaged by the acid produced by sourdough resulting in a weaker gluten network. You'll notice that for instance if your dough was nice and round and then suddenly it's very sticky.</p>
